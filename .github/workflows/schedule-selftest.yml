          ## Self-test failure

          A scheduled test of the workflow has failed.

          This suggests one of three conditions:
          * A backwards-incompatible change in a Sigstore component;
          * A regression in \`gh-action-sigstore-python\`;
          * A transient error.

          The full CI failure can be found here:
